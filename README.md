# Event Platform

This project is a web-based event management platform. It allows users to create, manage, and attend events seamlessly. The platform is built using React for the front-end, with plans to integrate a robust back-end for handling user authentication, event data, and payments.

- **Custom Event Pages**: Each event has a dedicated page that can be customized with themes and branding.
- **Guest Management**: Users can manage guest lists, send invitations, and track RSVPs.
- **Ticketing and Payments**: Support for ticket sales and donations through multiple payment gateways.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system (to be integrated).
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Track event attendance and user engagement (to be integrated).
